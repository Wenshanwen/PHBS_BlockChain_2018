## 1.	Overview on characteristics of blockchain, pain points of current industries 
Blockchain is a method of storing data amongst multiple parties that ensures data integrity, or blockchain is a new application mode of computer technology such as distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanism, and encryption algorithm. And consensus mechanism is a mathematical algorithm for realizing trust and acquiring rights between different nodes in the blockchain system. Blockchain has decentralization, not tampering, traceable, anonymous, trustless, consensus, global and other excellent features. These characteristics will change the inherent patterns of some industries to improve efficiency and solve pain points, next, I will analyze them one by one.

### 1.1	Decentralized	
At present, a centralized platform is needed for connection in most industries in order to build trust and establish the platform endorsement and the model is called “node-centralized platform-node”. It is the most obvious in Internet platform in China. The Internet platform gives the users endorsements and builds trust between each other. For example, e-commerce platform is to build trust between users and businesses, and the process of shopping becomes "buyers pay → e-commerce platform gets money → e-commerce platform notifies the sellers to deliver → buyers confirm the receipt → e-commerce platform gives the money to the sellers". And e-taxi platform is to build trust between drivers and passengers, and the process of taxiing becomes “passengers call e-taxi platform → e-taxi platform assigns order to drivers  → drivers accept order → passengers pay  → e-taxi platform gets money  → drivers get the money from the e-taxi platform”.

Throughout the transaction, the centralized platform holds all the data of the transaction, as well as the identity information of both parties. At the same time, as a commercial profit organization, the platform must get commissions to obtain benefits from it. As the value of the data is attached importance to, users pay more attention to the confidentiality of personal information, but the leakage problem becomes more and more serious, such as the user's mobile phone number, address, etc. The centralized platform is responsible for the preservation and confidentiality of data, but it is inevitable that there will be lost and leaked. It is also the common that various platforms are also making efforts in information confidentiality at present.

The decentralization of the blockchain is given enough space to imagine by the entrepreneurs. They want to exclude the centralized platform from the transaction, and establish the connection from the users to users in the peer-to-peer transactions, and hope to change the current industry structure that the centralized platform will no longer dominates. The current startups have already begun to try in sharing the ride and medical, and we will analyze it later.

### 1.2	Traceable and not tampering database
Many industries need to record a large amount of data and ensure the integrity of the data at present, and hope to trace the source of the data changes. During the process the key is to ensure the data not be tampered. For the example, the use of charitable charity, there are some phenomena that the charitable funds are used by the private, and the unclear accounts damage the interests of donors and are not conducive to the development of the industry. If some improvements based on blockchain technology are made, the donors can know the use of funds because the transactions on the blockchain can be traced and the records can not be falsified,

In terms of supply-chain management, the supply-chain is a series of trading nodes that connect the entire process from the supply end to the sales. From manufacture to sellers, the products have gone through multiple stages of the supply chain. With blockchain technology, decentralization of the transactions are recorded permanently and this will reduce time delays, costs and errors. Many startups about blockchain are flooding into this industry. For example,  Provenance is building a traceable system for raw materials and products, Fluent gives a global supply-chain lending platform, and Skuchain creates blockchain-based products for B2B trading and supply-chain financial markets.

In the field of buying and selling property rights, the key in the process is lack of transparency during the transaction or after the transaction such as a large amount of paperwork, potential fraud, errors in public records, etc. and these are only a part of problems. The blockchain provides a way to achieve the need for paperless and fast transactions. Blockchain applications in the real estate can help record and trace the land titles, deeds, liens, etc. and it provides a platform for financial companies, property companies and mortgage companies. Blockchain technology is committed to securely storing files while enhancing transparency, reducing costs, and ensuring data security.

In the medical field, medical institutions have to endure the inability to share data securely on platforms. Better data collaboration between data providers means more accurate diagnosis, more effective treatment, and improvements of the abilities to give medical system's cost-effective medical services. Blockchain technology allows hospitals, patients, and other parties in the chain to share data across blockchain networks without worrying about the security and integrity of the data.

### 1.3	Global
Blockchain is a global network. Every user in the world may become a blockchain node and join the blockchain network. Cross-border payment is regarded as one of the main areas of blockchain reform. Now cross-border payment is widely adopting SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication), and the reason is that it establishes a unified expression, but the main problem is that only institutions in SWIFT can conduct cross-border payment transactions, and it takes at least 24 hours, and the transaction cost is very expensive. At the same time, the inconsistent currency types cause that the banking institutions need to hold the currencies of many countries. 

The blockchain is based on a global network and can be used by all users to accomplish real-time transactions. Since there is only one digital currency, participants do not need to exchange multiple currencies and decentralization also reduces users’ transaction cost.

## 2.	Specific analysis of the applications of blockchain on Industries
Next, I will analyze the application of blockchain in different industries or fields, including shared rides, cross-border payments, right confirmation, medical data shares, public welfare, supply chain management, etc. and I will focus on the situation of current companies and development prospects blockchain application in these industries.

### 2.1	Taxi platform: shared ride
Uber seems to be a decentralized negative case where a company acts as a dispatch center and uses its algorithms to control the fleet drivers. The startup of La'zooz in Israeli wants to be an "Anti-Uber" that uses its proprietary digital currency, called Zooz, to record by using their blockchain digitization. People can no longer use a centralized network taxi to call the car service, but use La'zooz to find other people's travel routes, and exchange digital currency for hitchhiking.

Users can join the sharing network after downloading the La’Zooz app. Drivers and passengers can join the network and earn Zooz’s coins in their own way. When the number of drivers joining the app in a region reaches a certain number (about 30%), the users can take a taxi in the same direction.

In terms of payment, the users do not have to pay in cash, but pays in Zooz’s coins, and the coins are recorded in the driver's account after payment. La’Zooz differs from other online travel providers in that Uber and more providers are more like that drivers provide rental services to make money, and La’Zooz offers true sharing services.
![Taxi platform shared ride](https://github.com/Wenshanwen/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/Taxi%20platform%20shared%20ride.jpg "Taxi platform shared ride")

Prospects: The current taxi software is still a centralized platform. It is not really sharing. The startups want to subvert the current taxi industry through the decentralization of the blockchain, but in reality, it is more like hitchhiking. From the current technology, a large number of users are required to join the network, and use digital currency for transactions and settlements whether they are the drivers or the passengers. For the current taxi industry, the use of blockchain applications is too easy, and full-time taxi drivers prefer the current the taxi platform. The idea of blockchain application is too idealistic, and it is more inclined to the non-professional driver's hitchhiking. They get the income by the way, so the industry pattern will be small and it is difficult to subvert the current market.

### 2.2	Cross-border payments
Because the blockchain has the characteristics of not tampering and smart contracts etc., the participants of cross-border remittances have real-time and credible information verification channels, and remittances can be traced and safer. Meanwhile, because the privacy protection model is adopted in the alliance chain, the user's information can be more comprehensively guaranteed. Blockchain technology also reduces risk, enabling cross-border remittances to achieve more transparent regulation and more efficient risk control.
![Cross-border payments](https://github.com/Wenshanwen/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/Cross-border%20payments.jpg "Cross-border payments")

Ripple Labs is a start-up company founded in 2012, which is to promote Ripple as a standard trading protocol common to all major banks around the world, and make money transfers as cheap and convenient as e-mail. Currently, Ripple networks mainly services for small cross-border payment users. Like Bitcoin, Ripple is also a shareable public database, and it is also a global revenue and expenditure ledger. The consensus mechanism allows all computers in the Ripple network to automatically accept updates to the general ledger information in seconds without going through the central data exchange. This processing speed is a major breakthrough in Ripple's engineering. It means that Ripple's transaction confirmation time is only 3 to 5 seconds, which also ensures that cross-border payment users can transfer money in real time.

In addition, on June 25, 2018, the world's first blockchain-based e-wallet cross-border remittance service was launched in Hong Kong. Users of the Hong Kong version of Alipay, AlipayHK, can send money to the Philippine wallet Gcash through blockchain technology. AlipayHK partnered with Gcash, became the world's first e-wallet to use the blockchain across the border for cross-border remittances, and Standard Chartered Bank is responsible for day-end fund clearing and foreign exchange. Gcash users can spend immediately after they arrive, and cross-border remittances can be paid in real time like domestic transfers.

Prospects: Traditional cross-border payments have multiple pain points, such as low transaction efficiency, high transaction costs, and occupying foreign currency reserves of banks. The digital currency of blockchain can solve the above problems exactly. Cross-border payment is considered to be the earliest commercial application of the blockchain. Banks and financial institutions are actively involved in the development of this field. For example, the financial institution blockchain alliance R3 launches the platform, called Corda, which is committed to building global financial institution network, dealing with complex transactions, such as transactions dealing with securities and financial derivatives, and processing payment transactions through blockchain technology. The field is still highly anticipated in the future.

### 2.3	Right confirmation or Warrant registration
The core of the blockchain-based database is that it cannot be tampered with, and the Right confirmation and Warrant registration need to ensure data security and cannot be tampered with. For example, the blockchain application in real estate can help record, track and transfer land ownership and property to ensure that the document is accurate and verifiable;
![Right confirmation or Warrant registration](https://github.com/Wenshanwen/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/Right%20confirmation%20or%20Warrant%20registration.jpg "Right confirmation or Warrant registration")

Ubitquity LLC is a blockchain startup that uses blockchain to protect residential property rights in the United States. It is a Software-as-a-service (SaaS) blockchain platform for financial companies and mortgage companies. The goal is to ensure file security while increasing transaction transparency and reducing costs. Ubitquity can help record, track and transfer land ownership, property deeds, liens, etc. and can help ensure the accuracy and verifiability of all documents.

At present, Software-as-a-service (SaaS) blockchain platform has been already applied in the market. In 2016, Ubitquity launched a beta trading platform and cooperated with Atlantic Sotheby International Real Estate to realize the transfer of property rights. In April 2017, Ubitquity announced that it would start a pioneering partnership with the Brazilian Real Estate Registry. The land registries of two Brazilian cities had completed innovation by embedding land ownership information into the Bitcoin blockchain.

Prospects: Blockchain technology can help real estate companies, property rights registration agencies and other institutions to establish a traceable, non-tamperable database, to ensure that the rights can be not tampered with and verified. Many countries have active participation in this regard and government registration agencies are the main users of the application in this field. Therefore, for start-up companies, the government's legal recognition is the key to the application of the right to confirm, and the government institutions' own participation in the reform of the property rights registration model is also the possibility of future development.

### 2.4	Healthcare field
Blockchain technology allows parties in the hospital, patient, and healthcare benefit chains to share data across blockchain networks without worrying about the security and integrity of the data. In the field, startup Gem has released the Gem Health Network, which provides an Ethereum platform for multi-signature and multi-factor authentication technology to create a secure and versatile data structure. And Tierion is another blockchain startup that has built a platform for medical data storage and validation. By the way, both Gem and Tierion collaborate with Philips Healthcare in the blockchain laboratory at Philips.

Founded on January 22, 2014, Gem is a blockchain start-up that develops applied healthcare and supply chain management. Gem has a core platform for blockchain application solutions consisting of five products: Gem Apps, Gem Identity, Gem Logic, Gem Data, Gem Network. These five products together form a complete blockchain application ecosystem.
![GEM OS](https://github.com/Wenshanwen/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/GEM%20OS.jpg "GEM OS")

In April 2016, Gem launched the Gem Health Network (GHN) project to develop healthcare applications and infrastructure based on the Ethereum blockchain. Focusing on optimizing the supply chain and optimizing medical data management, Gem Health is committed to providing the healthcare industry with a convenient way to protect patient data and enable it to be shared across departments in real time through blockchain technology. Through smart contracts and a unified network to manage data, Gem Health has created a transparent, cross-institutional network where healthcare companies and partner organizations can share sensitive information, such as medical data and certification, in a protected ecosystem.

In October 2016, GemOS was released to automate medical services through blockchains, which are the infrastructure used to deploy decentralized applications and platforms. Through Gem, financial institutions, medical companies, and companies that rely heavily on data can connect existing systems to the GemOS blockchain network in the future, enabling automated management and data sharing within connected systems.

Prospects: Sharing medical data will increase the probability of accurate diagnosis and help doctors propose more effective treatments, but hospitals and medical institutions have been trapped in unsafe cross-platform sharing of data. Blockchain technology allows hospitals, patients, fee payers, etc. to share access to the network without compromising the security and integrity of the data. The sharing and security of medical data has always been pain points for the medical industry. Blockchain technology can be solved perfectly, with confidentiality and security. Gem has obtained 5 rounds of financing from 23 investors, with a financing amount of US$12.5 million which prove that the industry is optimistic about the application in this field.

### 2.5	Public interest
BitGive is the first non-profit tax-exempt organization to get the approval about 501c(3) in the world. Bitcoin's basic blockchain technology is known for its transparency and traceability and is required by non-profit organizations. GiveTrack developes a blockchain-based solution to provide the ability to transfer, track and deliver permanent records of global philanthropic transactions by the BitGive development team. By using GiveTrack, charities can increase trust with donors.
![Public interest](https://github.com/Wenshanwen/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/Public%20interest.jpg "Public interest")

The platform provides unprecedented transparency for non-profit financing by enabling a fund transfer and tracking solution. It also retains all transaction records forever, including information about the source and the use of funds. GiveTrack’s transparency also complements the accountability mechanisms of non-profit organizations, which not only benefits the intended beneficiaries of the donated funds, but also makes the organization's entire regulatory process more effective. However the blockchain technology requires more donors to donate in the form of digital currency. Due to the uncertainty of the value of digital currency, there are certain problems in the value of donated assets.

Prospects: The traceability and the transparent characteristics of the blockchain perfectly adapt to the requirements of the public welfare. The book data of the public welfare can be recorded and the donors can check the flow of the funds donated timely. It perfectly solves the problems of the industry and can be regarded as the hope of domain reform about public welfare. Although the uncertainty of the value of digital currency may cause problems for donors, the industry is seeking solutions other than digital currency, mainly to play the role of data books. In China, Easy to Raise、Ant Financial, Jingdong Finance and other institutions are involved in the blockchain public welfare field, and will have a clear prospect in the future.

### 2.6	Supply chain management
One of the most common aspects of blockchain is its ability to monitor transactions more securely and transparently. The supply chain is a series of trading nodes that link products from point A to point of sale or final deployment. As products move from manufacturing to sales to the blockchain, these transactions can be permanently recorded in decentralized blockchains, reducing delays, costs, and human error.
![Supply chain management](https://github.com/Wenshanwen/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/Supply%20chain%20management.jpg "Supply chain management")

Founded in 2013, London-based blockchain startup Provenance provides blockchain-based supply chain transparency and tracking services, which enables brand owners to track the origin and history of product materials, raw materials and products (including where the products are produced and by whom they are produced to reveal the environmental impact information of the products), and to provide consumers with information about physical products to help them The purchased items make a positive choice.

Provenance aims to create a sense of trust throughout the supply chain system by deploying a blockchain system based on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Record every new event in the global retail supply chain on the blockchain and enable real-time retrieval by consumers.

In May 2017, London fashion designers collaborated with blockchain start-up Provenance through the Provenance blockchain platform, use the QR code and NFC tags on the original clothing to understand the complete historical information of each piece, including the whole process from idea to sale. In July 2017, it received $800,000 in new seed round financing.

prospects: Blockchain technology leverages its transparent, traceable, non-tamperable database features to address the pain points of the current supply chain, reduce fraud and excess costs, and improve quality, which can also lead to accelerated capacity and sales and help the industry develop faster. Applications in this field are widely optimistic, for example, Wal-Mart, IBM, JD, Tsinghua and other blockchain alliances set up food supply chains.

## 3.	Summary
Based on the decentralization, traceability, non-tamperability and other characteristics, blockchain has produced a large number of startup companies in different industries, more than the industrial applications listed above. The most promising application in blockchain is based on the characteristics of database. It can be traced and not tampered to ensure the security and transparency of the database. Therefore, it has better application prospects for data confidentiality and high security industries, but excessive use of digital currency and trading need to consider the legal status of more digital currencies and the impact of value fluctuations. Blockchain technology has the advantage of decentralization, but not all industries currently based on decentralized platforms can achieve better development or efficiency. The advantages and disadvantages brought by the blockchain technology need to be comprehensively considered. The blockchain technology is not yet fully mature at present, and it is necessary to continuously improve the technology and the application of the data book.
